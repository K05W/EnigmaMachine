UNTIL THE RELEASE OF THE OSCAR-NOMINATED FILM THE IMITATION GAME, THE NAME
ALAN TURING WAS NOT VERY WIDELY KNOWN. BUT HIS WORK DURING THE SECOND
WORLD WAR WAS SO CRUCIAL THAT WINSTON CHURCHILL ACKNOWLEDGED HIS ROLE,
SAYING THAT TURING MADE THE SINGLE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTION TO ALLIED
VICTORY. WHO WAS TURING AND WHAT DID HE DO THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT?

ALAN TURING WAS A BRILLIANT MATHEMATICIAN. BORN IN LONDON, HE STUDIED AT
BOTH CAMBRIDGE AND PRINCETON UNIVERSITIES. HE WAS ALREADY WORKING PART-TIME
FOR THE BRITISH GOVERNMENTS CODE AND CYPHER SCHOOL BEFORE THE SECOND WORLD
WAR BROKE OUT. TURING TOOK UP A FULL-TIME ROLE AT BLETCHLEY PARK IN
BUCKINGHAMSHIRE, WHERE TOP SECRET WORK WAS CARRIED OUT TO DECIPHER THE
MILITARY CODES USED BY GERMANY AND ITS ALLIES.  

THE MAIN FOCUS OF HIS WORK AT BLETCHLEY WAS IN CRACKING THE ENIGMA
CODE. THE ENIGMA WAS A TYPE OF ENCIPHERING MACHINE USED BY THE GERMAN ARMED
FORCES TO SEND MESSAGES SECURELY. ALTHOUGH POLISH MATHEMATICIANS HAD WORKED
OUT HOW TO READ ENIGMA MESSAGES AND HAD SHARED THIS INFORMATION WITH THE
BRITISH, THE GERMANS INCREASED ITS SECURITY AT THE OUTBREAK OF WAR BY
CHANGING THE CIPHER SYSTEM DAILY. THIS MADE THE TASK OF UNDERSTANDING THE
CODE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT.

TURING PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THIS, INVENTING, ALONG WITH FELLOW CODE-BREAKER
GORDON WELCHMAN, A MACHINE KNOWN AS THE BOMBE. THIS DEVICE HELPED TO
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE WORK OF THE CODE-BREAKERS. GERMAN AIR FORCE
SIGNALS WERE BEING READ AT BLETCHLEY AND THE INTELLIGENCE GAINED FROM THEM
WAS HELPING THE WAR EFFORT.  

TURING ALSO WORKED TO DECRYPT THE MORE COMPLEX GERMAN NAVAL COMMUNICATIONS
THAT HAD DEFEATED MANY OTHERS AT BLETCHLEY. GERMAN U-BOATS WERE INFLICTING
HEAVY LOSSES ON ALLIED SHIPPING AND THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEIR SIGNALS
WAS CRUCIAL. WITH THE HELP OF CAPTURED ENIGMA MATERIAL, AND TURING’S WORK
IN DEVELOPING A TECHNIQUE HE CALLED BANBURISMUS, THE NAVAL ENIGMA
MESSAGES WERE ABLE TO BE READ FROM EARLY ON.

HE HEADED THE HUT EIGHT TEAM AT BLETCHLEY, WHICH CARRIED OUT CRYPTANALYSIS
OF ALL GERMAN NAVAL SIGNALS. THIS MEANT THAT, APART FROM DURING A PERIOD IN
1942 WHEN THE CODE BECAME UNREADABLE, ALLIED CONVOYS COULD BE DIRECTED AWAY
FROM THE U-BOAT WOLF-PACKS. TURING’S ROLE WAS PIVOTAL IN HELPING THE ALLIES
DURING THE BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC.

TURING DEVELOPED A COMPLEX CODE-BREAKING TECHNIQUE HE NAMED TURINGERY. THIS
METHOD FED INTO WORK BY OTHERS AT BLETCHLEY IN UNDERSTANDING THE LORENZ
CIPHER MACHINE. LORENZ ENCIPHERED GERMAN STRATEGIC MESSAGES OF HIGH
IMPORTANCE: THE ABILITY OF BLETCHLEY TO READ THESE CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO
THE ALLIED WAR EFFORT.

TURING TRAVELLED TO THE UNITED STATES TO ADVISE US MILITARY INTELLIGENCE IN
THE USE OF BOMBE MACHINES AND TO SHARE HIS KNOWLEDGE OF ENIGMA. WHILST
THERE, HE ALSO SAW THE LATEST AMERICAN PROGRESS ON A TOP SECRET SPEECH
ENCIPHERING SYSTEM. TURING RETURNED TO BLETCHLEY, WHERE HE CONTINUED HIS
WORK IN CRYPTANALYSIS. LATER IN THE WAR, HE DEVELOPED A SPEECH SCRAMBLING
DEVICE WHICH HE NAMED DELILAH. TURING WAS AWARDED AN OBE FOR HIS WARTIME
WORK.  

BEFORE THE WAR, TURING HAD INVENTED A HYPOTHETICAL COMPUTING DEVICE THAT
CAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE UNIVERSAL TURING MACHINE. AFTER THE SECOND WORLD
WAR ENDED, HE CONTINUED HIS RESEARCH IN THIS AREA, BUILDING ON HIS EARLIER
WORK AND INCORPORATING ALL HE HAD LEARNT DURING THE WAR. WHILST WORKING FOR
THE NATIONAL PHYSICAL LABORATORY, TURING PUBLISHED A DESIGN FOR THE
AUTOMATIC COMPUTING ENGINE, WHICH WAS ARGUABLY THE FORERUNNER TO THE MODERN
COMPUTER. THE ACE PROJECT WAS NOT TAKEN FORWARD, HOWEVER, AND HE LATER LEFT
THE NPL.  

THE LEGACY OF ALAN TURING’S LIFE AND WORK DID NOT FULLY COME TO LIGHT UNTIL
LONG AFTER HIS DEATH. HIS IMPACT ON COMPUTER SCIENCE HAS BEEN WIDELY
ACKNOWLEDGED: THE ANNUAL TURING AWARD HAS BEEN THE HIGHEST ACCOLADE IN THAT
INDUSTRY SINCE 1966. BUT THE WORK OF BLETCHLEY PARK, AND TURING’S ROLE
THERE IN CRACKING THE ENIGMA CODE, WAS KEPT SECRET UNTIL THE MUCH LATER,
AND THE FULL STORY WAS NOT KNOWN UNTIL THE FAIRLY RECENTLY. IT HAS BEEN
ESTIMATED THAT THE EFFORTS OF TURING AND HIS FELLOW CODEBREAKERS SHORTENED
THE WAR BY SEVERAL YEARS. WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT THEY SAVED COUNTLESS
LIVES AND HELPED TO DETERMINE THE COURSE AND OUTCOME OF THE CONFLICT.
